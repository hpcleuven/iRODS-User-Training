# Rule-building challenges (work in progress)

*Prerequisites:*  
*-A VSC account or your own iRODS-environment*  
*-Having completed 08_Rules_Handson_User-Training*


This last tutorial provides you with some optional challenges if you want to test what you just learned.  
These might challenge you to test out some new things on your own, and to rely on the [documentation](https://docs.irods.org/4.2.8/plugins/irods_rule_language/) and the [list of microservices](https://docs.irods.org/4.2.8/doxygen/).   
Good luck!
